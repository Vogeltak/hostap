This folder contains a number of files necessary for configuring the eap-noob example. 

To run this example do the following:
1.- Copy all the files in the current folder to the parent folder: "cp *.* ../"
2.- Navigate to the parent folder
3.- Generate a .config file with the proper config: "cp defconfig_eap_noob .config"
4.- run "make clean"  and "make"
5.- run "sudo ./hostapd ./hostapd.conf"
6.- In a different terminal navigate to ./webserver folder
7.- run "npm install"
8.- run "node index.js"


With the steps above we will be running a hostapd server configured to eap-noob and a simple node.js webserver to receive the oob messages.

Important!!:

1.- This server is configured by default to run in interface wlan0, if you need to change the interface do the proper changes in hostapd.conf
2.- The eapnoob.conf file contains a property called "ServerUrl" it is crucial that this URL is https and that it is reachable by whatever machine you are going
    to use to deliver the OOB message. In the default configuration it it set to localhost (127.0.0.1) because the default configuration is intented to be run
    in a standalone machine that has two wifis. "wlan0" will act as a eap-noob server and "wlan1" will act as a eap peer.

The next steps would be navigating to ../../wpa_supplicant/eap-noob-example and reading the README there to configure the peer
