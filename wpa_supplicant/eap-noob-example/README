This folder contains a number of files necessary for configuring the eap-noob example peer. 

To configure to run this example run: "./configure_eap-noob.sh"

To build and run wpa_supplicant:
1.- go to parent folder
2.- run "make clean"  and "make"
3.- run "sudo python3 ./run_eap_full -i wlan1"  (note that you can change to any other wlan interface you want to use as client)

To run the webserver:
1.- In a different terminal navigate to ./webserver folder


With the steps above we will be running a wpa_supplicant configured to eap-noob to connect to a "test" ssid.

Important!!:
1.- Note that we use wlan1 in the example for the peer. change it to any other wlan interface by replacing the corresponding part


The next steps would be navigating to ../../hostapd/eap-noob-example and reading the README there to configure the server
